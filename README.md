## Overview 
This is the software was intended to be used as a tech blog that my brother (Rosario Pulella) and I (Pasquale Pulella) would have used as our blog. We changed our mind about the blog and thus the project is no longer being developed. The code is still available for demonstration purposes.

## Dependencies
1. python
2. Flask_sqlalchemy
3. flask_dance
4. flask_login
5. markdown2
6. Flask

## Environment Variables
environment variables can be found on config.py. You can use the config file if you don't want to use environemnt variables.
1. DATABASE_STRING = enter string to tell the program where the database is
2. GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = Client id for the github oauth login
3. GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = Client secret for github's oauth

## Status
The project was still in development when it ended, and its kind of buggy but was very close to completion.
